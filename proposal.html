                    <h3>Overview of General Topic</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hustle culture is a big part of society and this pressures many people 
                        to set big goals far into the future, which makes many work hard to 
                        achieve those goals that they do not have time to think about what is 
                        happening in the present. Although it can lead to success, hustle culture 
                        can also lead to an unideal work-life balance that can ruin mental and 
                        physical well-being.

                    <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        An information technology problem that arises from hustle culture is 
                        that planner apps are geared toward setting goals and achieving them 
                        through tasks, but the main focus is the goal that will get completed 
                        sometime in the future. This means that people are more focused on their 
                        goals in the future rather than the events that are happening in the present.

                    <h3>Previous/Existing Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some examples of planner apps are
                        <a href="https://www.any.do/daily-planner/" target="_blank">any.do</a> and 
                        <a href="https://bordio.com/daily-planner/">bordio</a>. 
                        These two solutions have the problems that were mentioned in the previous 
                        section where they put all the focus on setting goals in the future.

                <h3>Who are the Users?</h3>
                <p>
                    Users can be of any age. They are people who want to take a break from 
                    having to deal with the big things in life and to instead take some time 
                    to live in the present and think about something positive. Since this app 
                    needs to be accessed through a computer, people who do not have access to 
                    computers would not be able to use this app.

                        Four Main Components User will be Interacting with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Checklist of things the user wants to complete that day</li>
                            <li>Moodboard with pictures the user wishes to place onto the bulletin board.</li>
                            <li>Diary page where the user can write down any notable events or thoughts that occurred on that day.</li>
                            <li>Sticky note where the user can write a positive thing that happened that day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        General Components of the App:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The user will be able to create their daily planner at the start of each day.</li>
                            <li>At 12:00 am everyday, the daily planner will be archived and users can access it anytime they want.</li>
                            <li>The user will have to login/sign-up by submitting a form with their username and password.</li>
                            <li>The user can pick their favorite daily planners and put them into a separate archive.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>What Kind of Information will the Users be Viewing?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The user will be viewing the data they put into the daily planner, 
                        so all the data for the website is curated by the user. For example, 
                        if the user fills out the checklist, they will be able to see the 
                        items in that checklist for the day. Another example is if the user 
                        wants to see their archived daily planners, they can click on a button 
                        that will allow them to see all the daily planners they have completed.

                    <h3>How will Using this App Solve the Chosen Problem?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since this app focuses only on a single day, the user can focus on what happens 
                        in their day and to live more in the moment. The sticky note that prompts the 
                        user to write down something positive that happened encourages the user to focus 
                        on the positive aspects of their day and to help them find joy in the little things.
